# Week Three Response

## Homework Cycle Summary

During this third homework cycle, we received an introduction to the high-level coding language, **p5.js**. The course asked us to perform a simple "Hello World!" project which we then replaced with a circle, called through the `ellipse()` function. Other basic setup functions like `createCanvas()` and `background()` were included within this introduction.

Additionally, the course provided a detailed walk-through of website mechanics--paying particular attention to how the course website functions and how we, as users, may interact with the code on the site.

## Assignment Completion Steps

1. I preformed a close read of the materials provided on Moodle and the [course website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-3/overview/). Included in this week's materials were a variety of links regarding the specifics of p5.js as well as videos explaining several, finer points.
2. I downloaded the required p5 library and the blank template files provided on the course website.
3. I spent some time playing within the website--working through the coding blocks and obtaining a sense of how the site factors in user input.
4. I carefully worked through each "TO DO" item, following the instructions provided.
  - For example, I created two initial p5.js sketches: the traditional "Hello World!" and the simple circle.
  - Also, I practiced using comments in my sketches this week as to start building good coding practices.  
5. Finally, I completed all three parts of Homework 3, committed them to master, and pushed my repository to GitHub.  

## Problems and issues

I encountered very few problems this week. My development machine worked exactly as intended and I feel comfortable navigating between Atom, GitHUb.com, and GitHub Desktop. The only hold-up I suffered occurred when I set up my website to go live. After receiving the "404 Error Page" I tacked the directory onto the end of the URL as directed. Still, the "404 Error Page" message flashed. I realized that **index.html** was rooted within another directory within **HW3**. After adding `\HW3\01_HelloWorld\` to the URL, my website went live.

## Further Discussion

I found a [simple tutorial](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/first-steps/) on p5.js basics that I've bookmarked to continue looking through and as a potential source tool for future issues.

## Classmate Assistance

During this homework cycle I've not yet been presented with an option to assist my classmates.

I will be continually checking the Issue Tracker throughout the week, hoping to provide assistance should it be needed.
