# Week Four Response

## Homework Cycle Summary

This fourth homework cycle focused on primitive, two-dimensional shape creation within the coding language, **p5.js**. Prior to 'drawing' any shapes within our Text Editor, however, the course provided us with a rundown on the coordinate grid, canvas size, and the mechanics of placing shapes within the canvas. Then we learned the call functions for basic shapes:
1. `rect();`
2. `triangle();`
3. `line();`
4. `point();`
5. `ellipse();`
6. `quad();`
7. `arc();`

Additionally, we were provided with the specific parameters required for each shape function.

Next, we moved on to color. The course offered information on how to invoke color in a variety of way--including RGB Color Mode, Grayscale, and Hexadecimal values. I found a site providing all of these values after the user chose a specific hue: [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).

Finally, the course walked through some very fundamental aspects of coding with **p5.js** like the Order of Operations that the language follows as well as the `push();` and `pop();` functions to enable code organization.

## Assignment Completion steps

1. I preformed a close read of the materials provided on Moodle and the [course website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-3/overview/). Included in this week's materials were a variety of links regarding the specifics of p5.js as well as several instances of embedded code that allowed us to play within the course website and practice skill building techniques.
2. I carefully worked through each "TO DO" item, following the instructions provided. In conjunction with the "TO DO" items this week, I started a directory containing all of Dr. Musick's guide's and reference's linked to the course this week.
3. Before beginning my sketch in **p5.js** I drew a rough copy on paper, including a coordinate plane, canvas size, and coordinate points for each shape.
4. Finally, I completed the necessary requirements for HW4, committed them to master, and pushed my repository to GitHub.

## Problems and issues

This week, I had a terrible time with the coordinate plane. After much trial an error, I realized that I had the negatives and positives of my y-values backwards. After I resolved this, however, my coding went smoothly and without error. I did not have to resort to checking the **Error Console**.

## Further Discussion

I found the book that the course requires invaluable this week. It provides everything you need to know about how shapes are made in **p5.js** as well as their specific requirements for input.

Also, I had purchase the [HTML and CSS Book](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) and perused them if I found the "Getting Started with p5.js" Book lacking.

## Classmate Assistance

During this homework cycle I've not yet been presented with an option to assist my classmates.

I will be continually checking the Issue Tracker throughout the week, hoping to provide assistance should it be needed.
